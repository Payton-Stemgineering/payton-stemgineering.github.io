                    <p><strong>Black History in STEM with the National Society of Black Engineers</strong></p>
                    <p class="subtext">To celebrate Black History Month, STEMgineering collaborated with the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) to highlight the achievements of Black professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Through panel discussions, historical presentations, and interactive activities, students learned about influential Black figures in STEM and discussed ways to promote equity and representation in the field. It was an inspiring event that combined education with meaningful dialogue.</p>

                    <p><strong>Winter Book Drive with Boys With Books</strong></p>
                    <p class="subtext">STEMgineering joined forces with Boys With Books to host a Winter Book Drive aimed at promoting literacy and access to educational resources. Students organized, promoted, and collected hundreds of donated books to be distributed to local schools and community centers. This initiative not only supported reading and learning in underserved communities, but also reinforced the idea that STEM education is deeply connected to strong foundational skills like literacy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Build Your Own Catapult Engineering Challenge</strong></p>
                    <p class="subtext">In this hands-on engineering project, students were challenged to design and build functional catapults using simple materials like rubber bands, popsicle sticks, and spoons. They applied principles of physics such as force, motion, and trajectory to test and refine their devices, aiming for both accuracy and distance. The challenge encouraged creative problem-solving, teamwork, and an understanding of engineering concepts in a fun and competitive format.</p>

                    <p><strong>Make Candy DNA</strong></p>
                    <p class="subtext">Students learned about genetics by constructing DNA models using candy. This interactive project helped them visualize the double helix structure of DNA and understand how base pairs function in genetic coding. By translating complex biological concepts into a tangible and tasty form, students were able to better grasp molecular biology in a memorable and enjoyable way.</p>
